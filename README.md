Client Info

I have uploaded the code for a the Client Info application.
The code is free to be used and can be edited and improved.

The ClientInfo App allows you to restore and retrieve information.
The information is stored in CSV. To start using the application.
Create a folder on your computer where you would like the data to be stored. Click on File, Select Database Path and browse to the location of the folder. Click OK
Next click File and New Database, Enter a name for the database you would like to Use and click OK.
Click File Open Database, Select the Database that you just created and click Open
You can now Capture a Client.
Example the client is BlueStream, you capture the information.
Next you can create a Template, Example would be Contacts, This will allow you to capture additional contact for any client on your computer.
